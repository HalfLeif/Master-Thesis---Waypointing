\section{Delimitation}

Although FamilySearch has indexed images in many languages from many places,
%Although there are images in many languages from many places,
the thesis only considers images of handwritten text in a single language from a single country but over a longer period of time, possibly up to three hundred years.
However, the techniques applied should be general enough to handle many different languages.
%, at least for extracting year and page number.

% We primarily consider deep learning techniques for solving the problem in contrast to conventional methods of handwriting recognition.

In order to simplify the model,
the system will classify each page with a single year although there may be none or several years present. For example, one image can contain baptisms from 1793 to 1797. In order to solve indexing, it is however necessary to correctly recognize all present values.
