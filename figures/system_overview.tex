\caption{Overview of the proposed network. First the encoder produces a matrix of feature vectors, each corresponding to a different but overlapping location in the input image. Secondly, the attention aggregates the feature vectors into a single feature vector. Lastly, the decoder produces a softmax output over the range of years.}
