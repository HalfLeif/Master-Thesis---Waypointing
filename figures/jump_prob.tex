        As expected, the following page is most likely the same year or the consecutive year. With laplace smoothing of $0.5$, the probability for a zero-transition is $56.5\%$ and the probability for a plus-one-transition is $29.1\%$. The interval $[-1,5]$ contains $95.5\%$ of the smoothed distribution.}
