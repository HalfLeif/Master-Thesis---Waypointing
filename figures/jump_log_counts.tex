    \caption{The plot shows $\log(1+\text{count}(x))$ for each label transition $x$ in the training set and the main test set.
    % With laplace smoothing of $0.5$, the probability for a zero transition is $56.5\%$ and the probability for a plus one transition is $29.1\%$. The interval $[-1,10]$ contains $96.3\%$ of the smoothed distribution.
