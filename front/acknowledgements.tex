\section*{Acknowledgements}

I send my gratitude and regards to my supervisor Rebecka JÃ¶rnsten, whose enthusiasm and ideas have greatly benefited the project.

I also thank Jon Morrey and Randy Wilson from FamilySearch, without whose data this thesis would not have been possible.

Lastly, I want to thank my wife Mai for her considerate loving support from the idea stage to the conclusion of the thesis.
