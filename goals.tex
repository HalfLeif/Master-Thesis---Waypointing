\section{Goals}

The goal of the thesis is to make an open-source prototype that automatically extracts high-level information for each photographed page of historical population records. The information under consideration is 1. year, 2. page number and 3. record type, where the record type is one of \{blank, birth, death, marriage\}.
% If time permits, extracting location (such as parish) will also be considered.

The system should learn from the currently indexed and waypointed data in a fully autonomous manner without explicit feature engineering.
% However, standard pre-processing techniques such as median filtering and gray level normalization may be necessary.

%A perfect classification is unrealistic so the resulting groupings of images will need some manual inspection before publication. However, it should be sufficient to check some of the pages in a group instead of going through every page. Thus the manual workload should be significantly decreased. If the precision of the system is too low, correcting errors would be equally troublesome as doing the waypointing manually. Thus, the precision of the classification should be as high as possible.

% While maximizing the precision, the system should have a reasonable throughput. Processing millions of photographed pages should be viable.
